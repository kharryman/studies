Found 62% of the variance could be accounted for by genetic factors \nSocial\n-Social construction perspective argues that gender identity does not reflect underlying biological differences between people and instead these concepts are invented by societies. Gender dysphoria is a social condition when people are required to choose one of two particular paths\n-Ovesey and Person 1973- social relationships within the family cause gender dysphoria. GD in males is caused by boys experiencing extreme separation anxiety before gender identity has been established. \nAO3\nBiological\n-Brain sex theory has been challenged. Pol et al 2006 used MRI scans on transgender individuals and found that the size of the BST changed over a period of time. BST may be affected by hormone therapy \n-Other brain differences associated with gender dysphoria. Rametti et al 2011 studied another sexually dimorphic aspect of the brain. There are regional differences in white matter in males and females. White matter corresponded more closely to the gender that the individuals identified with. \nSocial\n-Strength of social constructionism is that not all cultures have two genders. Some cultures recognise more than two genders with many people now describing themselves as non-binary. \n- Issues with Ovesey and Person 1973 explanation.
