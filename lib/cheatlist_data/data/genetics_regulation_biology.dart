              "* The ribosome assembles around the mRNA to be read and the first tRNA (carrying the amino acid MET[AUG]). This initiation complex is needed in order for transl­ation to get started.\n* The mRNA is read one codon at a time, and the amino acid matching each codon is added to a growing protein chain.\n* Each time a new codon is exposed,\n→a matching tRNA binds to the codon\n→the existing amino acid chain (polyp­eptide) is linked onto the amino acid of the tRNA via a chemical reaction,\n→the mRNA is shifted one codon over in the ribosome, exposing a new codon for reading.\n* tRNAs move through the A, P, and E sites of the ribosome. This process repeats many times as new codons are read and new amino acids are added to the chain.\n* The finished polype­ptide chain is released. It begins when a stop codon (UAG, UAA, or UGA) enters the ribosome, triggering a series of events that separate the chain from its tRNA and allow it to drift out of the ribosome.\n* The polype­ptide may still need to fold into the right 3D shape, undergo proces­sin­g,get shipped to the right place in the cell, or combine with other polype­ptides before it can do its job as a functional protein."
