              "• AO1\n-Martin and Halverson's (1981) cognitive developmental theory argues that children's understanding of gender changes with age. Shares the view with Kohlberg that children develop their understanding by actively structuring their own learning.  \n-Schema are mental constructs which develop with experience and are used to organise knowledge. \n-Once a child has established gender identity around the ages of 2/3 they will search their environment for information which fits their gender schema. \n- Gender schema expands to include a wide range of behaviours and personality traits. Schemas are likely to be formed around stereotypes. By age 6, children have a fixed and stereotypical idea about gender.  \n-Children tend to have a better understanding of the schema that is relevant to their own gender. Pay more attention to their own gender identity. When aged 8, children develop elaborate schemas for both genders. \nAO3\n-One strength is that it is supported by evidence. Martin and Halverson 1983 found that children under age 6 were more likely to remember photos of gender-appropriate behaviour when tested. \n-One limitation is that gender identity probably develops earlier than suggested. Zosuls et al 2009 looked at the onset of gender identity in a longitudinal study. Gender identity occurred at around 19 months. \n-However, Martin and Halverson suggest that we shouldn't focus on specific ages as the ages they used were averages. We should instead focus on the sequence of events. \n- Another strength is that it can account for cultural differences. Cherry 2019 suggests that gender schemas also include culturally appropriate gender behaviours."

              "• AO1\n-Kohlberg's (1966) cognitive developmental theory of gender is based on the idea that a child's understanding of gender becomes more sophisticated with age. This comes as a biological maturation. \n-Stage 1 (Gender Identity)- Around 2, children can identify themselves as a girl or boy. This is gender identity. At age 3, children can identify others as male or female. Understanding gender is based on labels. \n-Stage 2 (Gender Stability)- At age 4, children acquire gender stability. This comes with the understanding that they will stay the same gender. They are often confused by external changes in appearance such as a man with long hair. \n-Stage 3 (Gender Constancy)- At age 6. children recognise that gender remains constant across time and situations and this is applied to others. No longer fooled by external appearance. Children will begin to seek out appropriate role models.  \nA03\n- Evidence does suggest that gender stereotyping does emerge around age 6. Damon 1977 told a story about George who played with dolls. The 6-year-olds thought it was wrong for George to be playing with dolls. \n-However, other research challenged the idea that it happens before age 6. Bussey and Bandura 1999 found that children aged 4 reported feeling good about playing with gender-appropriate toys. \n-One limitation of the theory is supporting research relies on unsatisfactory methods to assess gender constancy. Bem 1989 criticised the methodology used in the studies. The best way to measure gender constancy is by showing physical differences. However, most studies focus on appearance and context. \n- There may be different degrees of gender constancy. Martin et al 2002 suggest that an initial degree of gender constancy is understanding the importance of gender, and the second degree relates to children's responsiveness to gender norms. \n-Could be considered to be part of the nature approach ad Munroe et al 1984 found that cognitive changes were universal and therefore biological."

All information in the LTM will have originally passed through the SR and STM, though may have undergone different forms of processing during the process. Research indicates that there are several different types of LTM, and the LTMs are not of equal strength. Strong LTMs can be retrieved easily, but weaker LTMs may require more prompting. LTMs are not passive (unchanging) -  over time they may change or merge with other LTMs. This is why memories aren't necessarily constant or accurate. There are several explanations for forgetting from the LTM. The process of shaping and storing LTMs is spread through multiple brain areas."
