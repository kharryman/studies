Influence of indiv's percieved susceptibility on health behav change  2. Percieved barriers and susceptibility are best redictors of healthy behav  3. Role of cues of action (external - informational input (warnings,knowledge)) in predicting health behav  Conflicting findings- Some research showed that behav change was related to low percieved severity  Criticisms of HBM- 1. Only focuses on conscious processing of info  2. Not much emphasis on social,envi,economic factors  3. Its a static approach to health belief - no room for change  4.
