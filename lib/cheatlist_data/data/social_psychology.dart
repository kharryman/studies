              "• According to behavi­orists, learning can be passive or active. In classical condit­ioning, enviro­nmental regula­rities and automatic reactions to them, for instance fear, pleasure, or reserv­ation, shape learning passively. On the other hand, operant condit­ioning views the learner as an active partic­ipant, who based on positive and negative reinfo­rce­ment, changes his or her behavior. During the social­ization process, operant condit­ioning is a more signif­icant type of learning."

              "• B. F. Skinner was a leading researcher on the effects that reinfo­rcement has on behavior and learning. In brief, rewards increase and punish­ments decrease a behavior. The theory of operant condit­ioning is useful for instance in animal training. Unlike animals, human beings do not need concrete rewards; instead, a smile that provides enough positive attention may be considered a reward. Similarly, a punishment can be anything from discipline to ignorance or disapp­roving looks. Discip­linary practices with children are often based on the principles of operant condit­ioning."

              "• Albert Bandura continued the work of early American behavi­orists and studied the importance of vicarious reinfo­rce­ment. He explored reasons behind aggression and noticed that behavior is learned from the enviro­nment through observ­ational learning and that people imitate the behavior of others. An actual person, a media or literature character, or written instru­ctions can constitute a behavioral model. Vicarious reinfo­rce­ment, i.e. learning though observing the conseq­uences of behavior for other people, increases behavioral confor­mity. That is, we tend to repeat behaviors that others are rewarded for and avoid behaviors for which other people are punished. Bandura named his theory social learning theory."
