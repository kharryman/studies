              "• According to behaviorists, learning can be passive or active. In classical conditioning, environmental regularities and automatic reactions to them, for instance fear, pleasure, or reservation, shape learning passively. On the other hand, operant conditioning views the learner as an active participant, who based on positive and negative reinforcement, changes his or her behavior. During the socialization process, operant conditioning is a more significant type of learning."

              "• B. F. Skinner was a leading researcher on the effects that reinforcement has on behavior and learning. In brief, rewards increase and punishments decrease a behavior. The theory of operant conditioning is useful for instance in animal training. Unlike animals, human beings do not need concrete rewards; instead, a smile that provides enough positive attention may be considered a reward. Similarly, a punishment can be anything from discipline to ignorance or disapproving looks. Disciplinary practices with children are often based on the principles of operant conditioning."

              "• Albert Bandura continued the work of early American behaviorists and studied the importance of vicarious reinforcement. He explored reasons behind aggression and noticed that behavior is learned from the environment through observational learning and that people imitate the behavior of others. An actual person, a media or literature character, or written instructions can constitute a behavioral model. Vicarious reinforcement, i.e. learning though observing the consequences of behavior for other people, increases behavioral conformity. That is, we tend to repeat behaviors that others are rewarded for and avoid behaviors for which other people are punished. Bandura named his theory social learning theory."

Boys and girls are encouraged to show distinct gender-appropriate behaviours is called differential reinforcement. \n-Indirect reinforcement- if the consequences of a person's behaviour is favourable, that behaviour is more likely to be imitated by a child. If consequences are unfavourable, then the behaviour is less likely to be imitated. \n- Identification refers to the process whereby a child attaches themselves to a person who is seen to be like me. These are known as role models. \n-Modelling is a precise demonstration of behaviour that may be imitated by an observer. \n-Social learning theory suggests 4 mediational processes that are central to learning gender:\n-----Attention; pays attention to what a role model does \n-----Retention; remembering what behaviour was done and trying to reproduce it\n-----Motivation; the desire to repeat the behaviour \n-----Motor reproduction; must be physically capable of doing the action, \nAO3\n-Key principles are supported by evidence. Smith and Lloyd 1978- babies were dressed as girls half the time and boys the other half. Babies assumed to be a boy picked up hammers and babies assumed to be girls picked up a doll. \n-However, differential reinforcement may not be the cause of gender differences. Adults may be responding to innate gender differences that are already there. Boys may be more active due to hormonal differences. \n- Can explain cultural changes in gender-appropriate behaviour. The shift in attitudes means that new forms of gender behaviour are unlikely to be punished and may be reinforced. \n- Does not provide an adequate explanation of how learning processes change with age. They suggest that modelling can occur at any age. However, its illogical to say that 2-year-olds learn the same way as 9-year-olds."
