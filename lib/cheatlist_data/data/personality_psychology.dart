You hear footsteps behind you and you begin to tremble, your heart beats faster, and your breathing deepens.  Due to these physiological changes your body prepares for a fearful situation.  You then experience fear.\n\nCannon-Bard Theory\n\n-Stimulating events trigger feelings and physical reactions that occur at the same time.\n\n-You are walking down a dark alley late at night. You hear footsteps behind you and you begin to tremble, your heart beats faster, and your breathing deepens. At the same time as these physiological changes occur you also experience the emotion of fear.\n\nSchachter-Singer (Two-Factor) Theory\n\n-Two factors are needed to experience emotion. First, environmental stimuli elicits a physiological response. Second, we cognitively appraise this physiological activity, and try to give it the correct label.\n\n-You are walking down a dark alley late at night.You hear footsteps behind you and you begin to tremble, your heart beats faster, and your breathing deepens. Upon noticing this arousal you realize that is comes from the fact that you are walking down a dark alley by yourself. This behavior is dangerous and therefore you feel the emotion of fear.\n\nLazarus' Cognitive-Mediational Theory\n\n-A thought must come before any emotion or physiological arousal. In other words, you must first think about your situation before you can experience an emotion.  the stimulus leads to a personal meaning derived from cognition, leading to both arousal and the emotion.\n\n-The sound of a gunshot, for example, is interpreted as something potentially dangerous and leads to both physiological responses, like a rapid heart rate and trembling, and the subjective experience of fear.\n-You are walking down a dark alley late at night.  You hear footsteps behind you and you begin to tremble, your heart beats faster, and your breathing deepens. Upon noticing this arousal you realize that is comes from the fact that you are walking down a dark alley by yourself. This behavior is dangerous and therefore you feel the emotion of fear."
