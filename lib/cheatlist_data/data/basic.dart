It affects about 1 in 600 males and those affected have an additional X chromosome. \n-One effect of KS has reduced body hair with some breast development in puberty. People may have problems with coordination or clumsiness. \n- KS is linked to poorly developed language skills and reading ability. Tend to be passive and shy and lack interest in sexual activity\n- Turners syndrome is caused by the absence of the two X chromosomes in females. It is referred to as XO.\n-Those with TS do not have a menstrual cycle and are sterile. They do not develop breasts and have a webbed neck. \n-Feature of TS is higher reading ability. Performance on memory and maths tasks are lower then normal. Tend to be socially immature. \nA03\n-One strength is its contribution to the nature-nurture debate. Able to see differences between two groups and that these differences have a biological basis. \n-However, the relationship between chromosome abnormalities associated with KS and TS and the differences in these behaviours are not causal. Social factors may be important. Social immaturity seen in females with TS could be due to them being treated immaturely. \n-Another strength is its application to managing the conditions. Continued research in this area is more likely to lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Herlihy et al 2011- those who had be identified with KS at an early age ten to have better outcomes. \n- One issue with KS is the sampling. Only those with extreme characteristics are placed in the database which could skew the results. Boada et al 2009- have produced a more accurate image where those with KS do not experience cognitive or psychological problems."

However, Spence 1984 argues that there is more to gender identity then a set of typical behaviours of one gender. \n- Another strength is that is appears to be a valid and reliable way of measuring androgyny. The scale was developed with judges and had test retest reliability. However, it was developed over 40 years ago and ideas surrounding gender has changed since then. It does not have temporal validity. \n- It lacks generalisability as it was used on those in the United States and has western notions of gender included in it. This may not be shared across all cultures. \nExtra AO3\n-Bem suggested that being androgynous was beneficial but Adams and Sherer 1985 suggest that having more masculine traits are better as these are more accepted in Western Culture."

Hormones act upon brain development and the development of reproductive organs. Males and females produce many of the same hormones but in different concentrations. \n-Testosterone is a male hormone and controls the development of sex organs. High levels of testosterone are also linked to aggression. \n-Oestrogen is the female hormone and causes some women to experience heightened emotions and irritability during the menstrual cycle. \n-Oxytocin is more common in females than in men and is highly present when giving birth. The hormone helps with breastfeeding and is also known as the love hormone. \nA03\n- Evidence supports the role of sex hormones in gender development. Wang et al 2000 found that testosterone replacements improved sexual function, libido and mood. This shows that testosterone has a direct effect on males development \n- However, other evidence of testosterone s less convincing. Daryl O Connor et al 2004 found that with increased testosterone in males there were no significant increases in sexual behaviour. \n-Chromosomes and hormones ignore the social factors. Hofstede et al 2010 claim that gender roles around the world are more of a consequence of society than biology. Individualist countries are more masculine in their outlook. \n-Another issue is that this explanation is reductionist. The cognitive approach would draw attention to schemas and thought processes."

              "• AO1\n-Freud sees children pass through 5 biologically driven psychosexual stages that begin with the oral stage and ends with the genital stage. The third stage- the phallic stage- is when gender development occurs between ages 3 and 6. Prior to this stage, children have no concept of gender. \n-Oedipus complex- boys develop feelings toward their mothers. Have jealousy and hatred for their father who stands in the way. The boy recognises the father is more powerful and fears lead to castration anxiety. Due to this, the boy gives up his love for his mother and identifies with his father. \n-Electra complex- girls experience penis envy, seeing their mother as competition for their father's love. Girls have double resentment towards the mother- one for being in the way of the father, and the other for blaming them for not having a penis.  Over time, girls accept that they won't have a penis and then start to identify with their mothers. \n- Identification is when the sexes identify with their same-sex parent. \n- Internalisation is when the children take on board the gender identity of the same-sex parent. \nAO2\n- Used Little Hans as evidence. Little Hans had a fear of being bitten by a horse, Freud interpreted this as a fear of castration. \nAO3\n-There is some support for the Oedipus complex in gender development. Rekers and Morey 1990 rated the gender identity of boys in interviews. Of those judged to be gender disturbed, 75% had neither their biological father nor a substitute father living with them. \n-However, others say that the relationship between absent fathers and problems of gender identity is not supported. Bos and Sandfort 2010 found that children raised by lesbian parents felt less pressure to conform to gender stereotypes and were less likely to assume their own gender was superior. \n-Inadequate account of female development. Horney 1942 suggests that penis envy was a result of cultural rather than biological factors. Freud's theory is androcentric as it has been criticised as reflecting the male-centred Victorian era. \n-Lacks scientific credibility. Many concepts are largely unconscious so are hard to study. Popper 1959 suggests that the theory is pseudoscientific as his key ideas can not be falsified."

If behaviours are culturally specific then this supports the nurture debate. \n-Mead 1935- found that the Tchambuli women were dominant, which suggests that gender roles may be culturally determined. \n-Buss 1995 found consistent patterns in mate preference where women sought men who could offer wealth and resources. \nMedia\n-Media provides role models for children with who they can identify and imitate.\n-The media provides clear gender stereotypes with Bussey and Bandura 1999 finding that men were identified as ambitious, and independent and women as dependent and advice seekers. \n-The media gives information in terms of likely success at adopting these behaviours. Mitra et al 2019 found that girls who watched a detective drama were more likely to see themselves as capable of working outside the home. \nAO3\nCulture\n-Influence of culture is supported by evidence. Hofstede 2001 argues that industrialised cultures have changed the status of women which has increased their role in the workplace. \n-Meads's research has been criticised. Been accused of making generalisations based on a short period of study. There is observer bias and ethnocentrism. \nMedia\n-Media influence has its theoretical basis. Cultivation theory argues that the more one spends time watching television the more they are likely to believe it reflects reality. \n-Gender roles and media may not have a causal relationship. Durkin 1985 suggests that young children are not passive and uncritical of the media."

Lack of control\nOn a diet but buys cookies in the grocery store \"just in case.\"\n3. Absent-mindedness \nYour mind is wandering or thinking in other thing.
