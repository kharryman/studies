People may have problems with coordination or clumsiness. \n- KS is linked to poorly developed language skills and reading ability. Tend to be passive and shy and lack interest in sexual activity\n- Turners syndrome is caused by the absence of the two X chromosomes in females. It is referred to as XO.\n-Those with TS do not have a menstrual cycle and are sterile. They do not develop breasts and have a webbed neck. \n-Feature of TS is higher reading ability.

              "• A01\n- Chromosomes are made from DNA. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes. Females is XX and males are XY. \n-Gender development comes about through the influence of hormones. Hormones act upon brain development and the development of reproductive organs. Males and females produce many of the same hormones but in different concentrations. \n-Testosterone is a male hormone and controls the development of sex organs. High levels of testosterone are also linked to aggression. \n-Oestrogen is the female hormone and causes some women to experience heightened emotions and irritability during the menstrual cycle. \n-Oxytocin is more common in females than in men and is highly present when giving birth. The hormone helps with breastfeeding and is also known as the love hormone. \nA03\n- Evidence supports the role of sex hormones in gender development. Wang et al 2000 found that testosterone replacements improved sexual function, libido and mood. This shows that testosterone has a direct effect on males development \n- However, other evidence of testosterone s less convincing. Daryl O Connor et al 2004 found that with increased testosterone in males there were no significant increases in sexual behaviour. \n-Chromosomes and hormones ignore the social factors. Hofstede et al 2010 claim that gender roles around the world are more of a consequence of society than biology. Individualist countries are more masculine in their outlook. \n-Another issue is that this explanation is reductionist. The cognitive approach would draw attention to schemas and thought processes."

The third stage- the phallic stage- is when gender development occurs between ages 3 and 6. Prior to this stage, children have no concept of gender. \n-Oedipus complex- boys develop feelings toward their mothers. Have jealousy and hatred for their father who stands in the way. The boy recognises the father is more powerful and fears lead to castration anxiety. Due to this, the boy gives up his love for his mother and identifies with his father. \n-Electra complex- girls experience penis envy, seeing their mother as competition for their father's love. Girls have double resentment towards the mother- one for being in the way of the father, and the other for blaming them for not having a penis.  Over time, girls accept that they won't have a penis and then start to identify with their mothers. \n- Identification is when the sexes identify with their same-sex parent. \n- Internalisation is when the children take on board the gender identity of the same-sex parent. \nAO2\n- Used Little Hans as evidence. Little Hans had a fear of being bitten by a horse, Freud interpreted this as a fear of castration. \nAO3\n-There is some support for the Oedipus complex in gender development. Rekers and Morey 1990 rated the gender identity of boys in interviews. Of those judged to be gender disturbed, 75% had neither their biological father nor a substitute father living with them. \n-However, others say that the relationship between absent fathers and problems of gender identity is not supported. Bos and Sandfort 2010 found that children raised by lesbian parents felt less pressure to conform to gender stereotypes and were less likely to assume their own gender was superior. \n-Inadequate account of female development. Horney 1942 suggests that penis envy was a result of cultural rather than biological factors. Freud's theory is androcentric as it has been criticised as reflecting the male-centred Victorian era. \n-Lacks scientific credibility. Many concepts are largely unconscious so are hard to study. Popper 1959 suggests that the theory is pseudoscientific as his key ideas can not be falsified."

If behaviours are culturally specific then this supports the nurture debate. \n-Mead 1935- found that the Tchambuli women were dominant, which suggests that gender roles may be culturally determined. \n-Buss 1995 found consistent patterns in mate preference where women sought men who could offer wealth and resources. \nMedia\n-Media provides role models for children with who they can identify and imitate.\n-The media provides clear gender stereotypes with Bussey and Bandura 1999 finding that men were identified as ambitious, and independent and women as dependent and advice seekers. \n-The media gives information in terms of likely success at adopting these behaviours. Mitra et al 2019 found that girls who watched a detective drama were more likely to see themselves as capable of working outside the home. \nAO3\nCulture\n-Influence of culture is supported by evidence. Hofstede 2001 argues that industrialised cultures have changed the status of women which has increased their role in the workplace. \n-Meads's research has been criticised. Been accused of making generalisations based on a short period of study. There is observer bias and ethnocentrism. \nMedia\n-Media influence has its theoretical basis. Cultivation theory argues that the more one spends time watching television the more they are likely to believe it reflects reality. \n-Gender roles and media may not have a causal relationship.
