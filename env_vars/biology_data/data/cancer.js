The mutations are due to change in either a structural protein receptor for an antibiotic or a protein involved in drug transport\n2. Extrac­hro­mosomal transfer of drug-r­esi­stant genes\n2a. Tran­sfo­rma­tion: transfer of naked DNA between cells of same species\n2b. Tran­sdu­ction through R plasmi­ds: R plasmids are a sexual transfer of plasmid DNA in a bacteria virus between bacteria of the same species\n2c. Conj­uga­tion: the passage of gene from bacteria to bacteria via direct contact through a sex plus or bridge. Conjug­ation occurs primarily in GRAM NEGATIVE BACILLI. It is the principal mechanism of acquired resistant among entero­bac­teria\n2d. Tran­spo­sit­ion: occurs as a result of movement or \"­jumping or transp­oso­ns\" (stretches of DNA containing insertion sequences at each end) from plasmid to plasmid or from plasmid to chromosome and back"
