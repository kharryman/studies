Atoms and the bonds that hold them together contain energy; this energy is harnessed and utilized by the chemistry of life. The single most important molecule for life as we know it is water. Water's unique and vital properties are a direct conseq­uence of its chemistry. Atoms are the basic unit of matter (smallest) they are made of protons, neutrons and electrons. Each water molecule is made up of 2 H atoms and 1 O atom which are held together by a covalent bond. Water moves up the small space between to microscope slides= capillary action. Water sticks to a plastic surface when upside down= Adhesion. A paperclip can float on the surface of water= surface tension. Water sticks to other water molecules= Cohesion. Oxygen has an atomic mass of 16 and an atomic number of 8 so it has 2.6 electrons. Covalent bonds are formed when pairs of electrons are shared by atoms. A weak bond between 2 molecules resulting from an electr­o-s­tatic attraction makes a hydrogen bond. Ph Scale= the higher, the more basic, the lower, the more acidic."
